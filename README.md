# BVP Research - Hamiltonian Flow Methods

This repository contains code for boundary value problem research using Hamiltonian flow methods.

## Based On
This codebase is built upon Hamiltonian flow implementations for optimal transport.

## Structure
- `flows/hamiltonian_flow.py` - Main Hamiltonian integration
- `flows/hamiltonian_flow_step.py` - Symplectic Euler step
- `geometry/` - Metric tensor computations
- `functionals/` - Energy functionals
- `ODE_solvers/` - Numerical integrators
- `architectures/` - Neural network architectures
